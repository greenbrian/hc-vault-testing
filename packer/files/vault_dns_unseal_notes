DNSmasq is setup to handle all *.consul dns requests by forwarding those requests to
the local Consul agent running on port 8600

Some commands that can be performed:

  nslookup nginx.service.dc1.consul
  nslookup haproxy.service.dc1.consul
  nslookup active.vault.service.dc1.consul
  nslookup standby.vault.service.dc1.consul


Vault has been setup to automatically unseal.
The root token and unseal keys are in /tmp/vault.init on the active node
(which in the demo situation is the first to become active)

Easiest way to find the active node is within Consul UI
click on node, see services and active/standby will be shown for vault

  grep Root /tmp/vault.init | awk '{print $4}'

  grep Unseal /tmp/vault.init | awk '{print $4}'
